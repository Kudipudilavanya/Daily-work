In Python, operators are symbols or special keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. Here are some common types of operators in Python:

Arithmetic Operators:

python
 
x = 5
y = 2

addition = x + y       # 7
subtraction = x - y    # 3
multiplication = x * y  # 10
division = x / y        # 2.5
modulus = x % y         # 1 (remainder of the division)
exponentiation = x ** y  # 25 (x to the power of y)
Comparison Operators:

python
 
a = 5
b = 10

equal = a == b        # False
not_equal = a != b    # True
greater_than = a > b  # False
less_than = a < b     # True
greater_or_equal = a >= b  # False
less_or_equal = a <= b     # True
Logical Operators:

python
Copy code
p = True
q = False

logical_and = p and q  # False
logical_or = p or q    # True
logical_not = not p     # False
Assignment Operators:

python
 
x = 5

x += 3   # Equivalent to x = x + 3
x -= 2   # Equivalent to x = x - 2
x *= 4   # Equivalent to x = x * 4
x /= 2   # Equivalent to x = x / 2
Identity Operators:

python
 
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

identity_equal = a is b          # False (checks if the objects have the same identity)
identity_not_equal = a is not b  # True
Membership Operators:

 
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

in_list = 2 in my_list       # True
not_in_list = 4 not in my_list  # True
These are just a few examples of the many operators available in Python. Operators are fundamental for performing various operations in your programs. If you have specific questions about a particular type of operator or if you'd like to see more examples, feel free to ask!

User
sample program
 
Certainly! Here's a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and performs arithmetic operations on them:

python
 
# Get user input for two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Display the results
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")
print(f"Product: {product_result}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")
In this program:

The input() function is used to get user input for two numbers, and float() is used to convert the input to floating-point numbers.
Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are performed on the input numbers.
The results are then displayed using print().
