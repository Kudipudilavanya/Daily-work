In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable objects. The basic structure of a for loop is as follows:

python
 
for variable in iterable:
    # Code to be executed in each iteration
Here's a simple example of a for loop that iterates over a list of numbers and prints each number:

python
 
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
In this example:

The numbers list contains five elements.
The for loop iterates over each element in the list.
In each iteration, the current element is assigned to the variable num.
The print(num) statement inside the loop prints each number.
Using range() with for loop:
The range() function is often used with for loops to generate a sequence of numbers. Here's an example that prints numbers from 1 to 5 using range():

python
 
for num in range(1, 6):
    print(num)
In this case, range(1, 6) generates the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Feel free to run these examples and experiment with different sequences or iterables. If you have specific questions about for loops or if you'd like to see more examples, let me know!

 
Certainly! Here's a sample program that uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of a given number:

python
 
# Get user input for a number
number = int(input("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "))

# Initialize the factorial result to 1
factorial_result = 1

# Calculate the factorial using a for loop
for i in range(1, number + 1):
    factorial_result *= i

# Display the factorial result
print(f"The factorial of {number} is: {factorial_result}")
In this program:

The user is prompted to enter a number.
The factorial_result variable is initialized to 1.
The for loop iterates through the range from 1 to the entered number (inclusive) and multiplies the current value of factorial_result by the loop variable i.
After the loop, the program prints the calculated factorial.
