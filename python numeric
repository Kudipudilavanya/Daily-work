In Python, numbers can be represented using different data types. The two main types for representing numbers are integers (int)
and floating-point numbers (float). Here's a brief overview:

Integers (int): Whole numbers without a fractional component.

python
 
x = 5
Floating-Point Numbers (float): Numbers with a decimal point or in scientific notation.

python
 
y = 3.14
Python also provides some additional functionality for working with numbers:

Complex Numbers (complex): Numbers with a real and an imaginary part.

Copy code
z = 2 + 3j
Math Operations: Python supports standard mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) for both integers and floating-point numbers.

Example:

python
 
a = 10
b = 3
result_addition = a + b
result_multiplication = a * b
These are the basic concepts related to numbers in Python. Depending on your specific needs, you might also explore additional modules like math for more advanced mathematical operations.

Certainly! Here's a sample Python program that demonstrates the use of different number types and basic mathematical operations:

python
 
# Integers
x = 5
y = 3

# Floating-Point Numbers
a = 2.5
b = 1.5

# Complex Numbers
z = 2 + 3j
w = 1 - 2j

# Math Operations
sum_integers = x + y
product_floats = a * b
difference_complex = z - w

# Displaying Results
print("Sum of integers:", sum_integers)
print("Product of floats:", product_floats)
print("Difference of complex numbers:", difference_complex)

# Additional Operations
division_result = x / y  # Division with float result
exponent_result = a ** 2  # Exponentiation

# Displaying Additional Results
print("Division result:", division_result)
print("Exponent result:", exponent_result)
In this program, we define variables of different number types (integers, floats, and complex numbers) and perform various
mathematical operations on them, such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and exponentiation. The results are then printed to the console.
