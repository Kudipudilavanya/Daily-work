 Python data types:

Integers (int): Whole numbers without a fractional component, like 5.

Floats (float): Numbers with a decimal point or in scientific notation, like 3.14.

Strings (str): Ordered sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes, like "John".

Booleans (bool): Represents either True or False, like True`.

Lists (list): Ordered and mutable sequences of elements, like [1, 2, 3, "four"].

Tuples (tuple): Ordered and immutable sequences of elements, like (1, 2, 3, "four").

Sets (set): Unordered collections of unique elements, like {1, 2, 3}.

Dictionaries (dict): Unordered collections of key-value pairs, like {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}.

These data types allow you to represent and manipulate different kinds of information in Python programs.



In Python, data types represent the type of value that a variable can hold. Here are some common Python data types:

Integers (int): Whole numbers without a fractional component.

python
 
x = 5
Floats (float): Numbers with a decimal point or in scientific notation.

python
 
y = 3.14
Strings (str): Ordered sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

python
 
name = "John"
Booleans (bool): Represents either True or False.

python
 
is_true = True
Lists (list): Ordered and mutable sequences of elements.

python
 
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "four"]
Tuples (tuple): Ordered and immutable sequences of elements.

python
 
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "four")
Sets (set): Unordered collections of unique elements.

python
 
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
Dictionaries (dict): Unordered collections of key-value pairs.

python
 
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
These are the basic data types in Python. Understanding them is fundamental for programming in Python and manipulating data in your programs.
